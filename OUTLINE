OUTLINE 1.0

to do:
get data of computer Linneaus Borg
get data files from UMCG
get reagens needed for the p-tau assays
write discussion and introduction and results


_introduction

-All endotherms are dependant on food as main external energy source.
-Fluctuations in food availability have major effects in small endotherms.
-During a circanual (yearly) cycle, significant changes in temperature occur in the habbitat of these endotherms.
-While many small endotherms have evolved their behaviour to stock up or horde food, mice do not generally do this.
-Daily torpor is then one alternative strategy to deal with harsh circumstances such as cold. 
-Especially for a small rodent like a mouse it is therefore important to have good spatial memory at all times.

-When we look at the brain physiology during torpor, tau phosphorylation, a striking similaritie to Alzheimers can be observerd.
-During torpor hyperphosporylated tau protein could be a defensive strategy agains all sorts of damage.
-This hyperphosphorylation is first observed in the hippocampus and spreads to the cortex.



-The day after mice enter torpor mice are able to rember a spatial task that was learned to them the day before.
-The behavioural effects of torpor implied a memory test that was never tested before in this mice strain
-Also the physiology of the body, and how it is able to defend agains this cold body temperature was assesed 

and physical effects of daily torpor we eployed 


_Methods:
-On top of that, the the mice were trained to run in a runningwheel to earn their food.
-The workload of the runningwheel was then slowly raised in both experimental groups, but not in the control group.
-Aditionally the workload of the Working Control group (WC) was raised 50% less compared to the Working For Food group(WFF)
-The mice were trained and tested c.q. 30 days after the start of the experiment on their ability to recognise moved objects for a prelearned set.
-Lastly all major organs of the mice were collected after c.q 60 days in the protocol.
